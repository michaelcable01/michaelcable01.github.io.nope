	<h1>	ABOUT STATE BICYCLE </h1>
<p>When we say State Bicycle Co. is rider-developed, we mean it. In 2009, State was launched by three Arizona cycling addicts with big dreams. The goal was and remains: to introduce premiere quality, aesthetically striking bicycles to the fixed gear/single speed market at a fantastic price.</p>
<h1> EMBRACING THE COMMUNITY </H1>
<p>Ask anyone who knows us: State Bicycle is passionate about fixed gear cycling and its emerging culture. We host weekly bike rides across the country, organize alleycat bike races, sponsor talented riders around the world, and partner with cycling advocacy groups. Our commitment to supporting both the local rider and greater riding community is the reason why weâ€™re in this business. Even if you never own a State Bicycle, there is plenty of reason to connect with the community we have been cultivating since the beginning.</p>
<h1>PRESS & REVIEWS </h1>
<p>We are grateful to have received overwhelmingly positive press from virtually every corner of the media world. But our favorite reviews, comments, and photos come straight from our customers via facebook and instagram</p>
